          <p><strong> Applejack </strong> is reliable and hard-working, although headstrong about doing things on her
            own.
            While normally kind and considerate, Applejack lacks patience with aggressive or rude behavior and has no
            hesitation in returning it in kind.
            She is more ill-tempered than the rest of her friends, with the possible exception of <strong> Rainbow Dash
            </strong>, who once ironically put it, "Sometimes, she's sour apples".
            Though she is careful to keep it under control, it can get the better of her sometimes and it often makes a
            bad
            situation worse. Above all Also, Applejack is known for her honesty
            (note her element), and because of that she appears to not be able to truly lie or cheat. Instead she
            struggles to
            devise half truths when it is absolutely necessary.</p>
